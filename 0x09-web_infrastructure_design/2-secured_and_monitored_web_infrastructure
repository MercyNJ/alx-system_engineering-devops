For every additional element, why you are adding it

Firewalls act as protective barriers between the servers and the internet, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
They add multiple layers of defense, increasing the difficulty for potential attackers to penetrate the system. 

An SSL certificate is added to serve the website over HTTPS. HTTPS encrypts data during transmission between the web server and the user's browser,
ensuring secure communication and protecting sensitive user data from interception.

3 monitoring clients collect and analyze server metrics, logs, and performance data from within the infrastructure.
The data collected helps identify anomalies, diagnose potential problems, and make data-driven decisions to optimize system performance and maintain high availability.

What are firewalls for
They help prevent unauthorized access attempts, protect against potential attacks,
and ensure the overall security of the web infrastructure.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
 To ensure secure communication between the website and users' browsers. 
HTTPS encrypts data during transmission, making it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept or eavesdrop on the communication.
This encryption prevents unauthorized access to sensitive user data while browsing.

What monitoring is used for
For tracking and observing the health, performance, and availability of a system or infrastructure.
With monitoring, administrators can plan for capacity needs, ensure high availability, and make data-driven decisions for resource management and system improvements.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Monitoring enables the identification of system issues, such as performance bottlenecks or failures,
and sends alerts to administrators to check if something is broken or slow.

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
The monitoring system should be configured with specific alerts triggered when the Queries Per Second (QPS) exceeds predefined thresholds,
ensuring administrators are promptly notified of potential issues related to query loads.

Issues are with this infrastructure:

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
It exposes the decrypted traffic between the load balancer and the backend servers.
This leaves the internal communication vulnerable to potential eavesdropping and security breaches,
compromising the confidentiality of sensitive data and increasing the risk of unauthorized access to the web servers.

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
It creates a single point of failure (SPOF) for write operations.
 If this single server becomes unavailable due to hardware failure, maintenance, or any other reason,
write requests to the database will be blocked, leading to service disruptions and data inconsistency. 

Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem.
It can lead to issues during maintenance as updates to one component may impact others on the same server.
