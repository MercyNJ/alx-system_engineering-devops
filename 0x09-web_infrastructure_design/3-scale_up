For every additional element, why you are adding it
1 Additional server: Added to scale up the infrastructure and handle increased traffic or serve
as a failover in case of high demand.
Split components : 
By splitting the components onto their own dedicated servers (Web Server, Application Server, and Database Server),
we achieve better resource isolation and utilization.
Each server can be optimized, scaled, and managed independently based on the specific workload of the component it hosts.

Load Balancer (HAproxy) Cluster:
The load balancer is configured as a cluster  to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Clustering provides redundancy.

One load balancer is designated as the active node, while the other acts as the standby node.

 The standby load balancer remains in a passive state, ready to take over if the active load balancer becomes unavailable or experiences issues.

Additional Firewall : 
The Additional Server is equipped with a dedicated Firewall  to control incoming and outgoing traffic,
ensuring enhanced security and protecting the server and its services from unauthorized access.
